# ImageSegmentationRRCNN
## Code for the course of CCAI 2021 Unict, RRCNN for image segmentation and medical applications

* In the __plot_imgs__ folder there are 4 pngs pictures showing the plots of training and validation accuracy for 0.25 and 0.5 threshold and also a .ipynb file containing the code
we used to generate these plots.
* The __results__ folder contains all the csv files we used to generate the plots (50 epochs) with all the evalutation metrics.
* The __src__ folder contains the source code of the project, with our changes to make it work on our gpu.
* The __Project-E-Pillitteri-LoPresti.pptx|.pdf__ is the power point presentation (also in pdf) that we made for the course.
